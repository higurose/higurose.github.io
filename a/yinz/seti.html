Has there ever been a boy as utterly useless and cowardly as Seti Marimbe? Probably. But maybe if he stopped pretending to be someone he's not, he wouldn't dissappoint everyone around him.
Socially flexible purely as a coping mechanism, Seti's true self only shows in moments of aggravation. His facade of friendliness and charm hides a shaky foundation for maintaining interpersonal relationships. Seti will go on a date with anyone who asks him out, whether or not he wants to go. bad at texting back. good at making music. he can't read.
