A loner, Misha gives off the impression of being self-sufficient; in reality he is constantly completely at a loss. Misha picks up skills quickly, but lacks the enthusiasm to commit to anything (or anyone). He’s more than comfortable going with the flow because he has no particular direction for himself. Misha’s friends are few and far between, and even they ask themselves whether or not they are his friends. Although he is generally unreliable, there are a handful of people he trusts, including his cousin, Kit. His favorite song is Jolene and he enjoys discovering new covers of it. He’s had, like, eight hundred part time jobs.
