			<b>SAGE KOSKI</b><br>
Around 6-feet tall and emanating chaotic energy even at rest, Sage is mayhem waiting to happen. Sage is set in their ways and doesn’t care how other people feel about their approach to life; everything they do makes perfect sense to them. Deeply empathetic, Sage is a master of setting and respecting personal boundaries but is cavelier when explaining their reasoning. Their absurdity is charming, to a point, but their enthusiasm can be off-putting. Their seemingly incomprehensible worldviews can’t save them from a nagging personal restlessness. No one knows what they’re thinking, and it seems like Sage might not either. They make their living as a painter of spiritual icons. They fear entering a state of permanent psychosis.
