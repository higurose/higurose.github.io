  <i>YINZ CITY</i> is a collection of stories following four transmasculine folks and their friends as they navigate found communities, awkward relationships, shitty part-time jobs and lame parties.<br>
  each issue focuses on one of four protagonists: Seti Marimbe, Kit Kitterson, Sage Koski, and Misha Kitterson. each of them deals with their own issues of trans people of color interacting with friends and whoever they run into over and over in a small city in western PA.<p>
    although <i>YINZ CITY</i> is not necessarily full of adult content, it is NOT written for an audience under the age of 18.
