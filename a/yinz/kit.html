A hard worker, Kit is shockingly well-adjusted for a 19 year old. Despite being emotionally perceptive, he struggles with knowing what to say to people. Kit unfortunately wants to be everyone's friend and tries to always see the best in people. His sincerity and enthusiasm can get a little grating after a while. Although he has an idea of where he wants to be, he isn't sure how to get there. He’s only just learning how to speak up so he’s prone to embarrassing himself. He might be a little too self-aware. Kit constantly lies about his age and even though no one believes him, no one says anything about it. He has a thing for older guys.
